## 📖 Description

Movie Explorer is a frontend React application that fetches real-time TV show and movie data from the [TVMaze API](https://api.tvmaze.com/shows). Users can browse a dynamic listing of shows, search by name, and manage a personal watchlist — all within a clean, component-based UI built with pure CSS.

This project was built to strengthen core React skills including component architecture, React Router DOM navigation, the Context API for global state management, and responsive layout using CSS Flexbox and Grid.

- ❤️ **Watchlist** — Add or remove movies from a personal watchlist using Context API
- 📄 **Watchlist Page** — Dedicated page to view all saved movies
- 🧭 **Navbar Navigation** — Smooth navigation between pages using React Router DOM
- 🧩 **Component-Based Architecture** — Clean, reusable components for maintainability

## 🧠 What I Learned

- How to **fetch data from a public REST API** using `useEffect` and `fetch` inside React
- How to implement **real-time search filtering** using controlled components and `useState`
- How to use the **Context API** to manage and share global state (watchlist) across multiple components without prop drilling
- How to structure a **multi-page React application** using React Router DOM (`<BrowserRouter>`, `<Routes>`, `<Route>`, `<Link>`)
- How to build a **responsive UI** using only CSS Flexbox and Grid — no external UI libraries
- How to design a clean, **component-based architecture** for scalable frontend development

---

## 🚀 Future Improvements

- [ ] Add **pagination or infinite scroll** for large movie lists
- [ ] Implement **movie detail modal or page** with full show information
- [ ] Add **genre-based filtering** alongside search
- [ ] Persist the watchlist using **localStorage** so it survives page refreshes
- [ ] Add **loading skeletons** for a better user experience during API fetch
- [ ] Improve **accessibility** with ARIA labels and keyboard navigation support
